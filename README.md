### Setting up and running:

- This project was made using NodeJS 14, I don't know if it works in other versions below it

Install NodeJS from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

or if you're a linux user (Ubuntu/Debian based distros):
```sh
sudo apt update

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -

sudo apt install nodejs -y
```

Clone this repository and run
```sh
npm i --save

Now you can start it using
